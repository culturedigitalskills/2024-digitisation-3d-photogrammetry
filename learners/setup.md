## Equipment

For photogrammetry you will need access to the minimum equipment.

- **Digital camera**: a compact or a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera can be used. Preferably you should use a camera that allows manual control. 

- **Resolution**: minimum resolution requirements are for a 5 MP camera. For better quality choose a camera with better resolution (e.g. 12 MP camera for professional quality).

- **Lens**: Fixed lenses are preferred but if you have a variable lens, try not to zoom and define one focal length (to its maximum or minimal value right from the start). A focal length of 50mm (as the eyes see it) or higher would generally work well (generally it is preferable not to go below 35mm). For small objects a lens between 60mm and 80mm would be an option or a macro lens could be used too.

The equipment below are optional but can speed the
process if you want to digitise many objects:


-	**Tripod** can be used if using a turntable for stable camera placement or for shooting when light conditions do not allow to maintain an aperture speed above 1/60 of a second when holding it by hand. 
- **Remote control** for the camera when an object needs to be rotated manually or the camera is placed away from the photographer.
- **Turntable** manual or automatic (which can be synchronized with the time of the camera shooting).
- **Diffused artificial light** to eliminate shadows as much as possible.
- **Circular polarizing filter** for reflective artefacts.
- **Laptop or PC** with at least 16GB RAM.

## Software required 

You will need access to:

A software which allows you to batch converting raw images from the camera might be useful if you have
been shooting in raw format. [Raw Therapee](https://www.rawtherapee.com/) is a good option.

An **Image processing software** such as [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) will also allow you to manipulate and post-process textures generated after the model has been created. 

There are various options for **photogrammetry software**. The process for generating the 3D model will vary depending on the software used. Some options include:

- [Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/)
- [Meshroom](https://alicevision.org)
- [3DF ZEPHYR](https://www.3dflow.net)
- [Reality Capture](https://www.capturingreality.com) 

[Comparisons](https://formlabs.com/blog/photogrammetry-guide-and-software-comparison/) between these softwares are available. In general, paid versions offer better support and are more user friendly, supporting
a variety of scales, formats and workflows.


We will use [**3DFlow ZEPHYR software**](https://www.3dflow.net), 
which has the advantage of being user-friendly and
provides various types of licenses such as the free educational one. Although there is a limitation
of only being able to process 50 images for creating
a 3D model.
