This lesson is an introduction to the photogrammetry technique 
to create 3D models. 

By the end of this lesson, learners will: 

- Be able to explain the basics of this technique and its effect on the practical aspects
of photogrammetry projects
- Determine which objects and environments will be suitable for this technique.
- Design the best setup and strategy to photograph objects.
- Use a software to process photographs which output a 3D model.
